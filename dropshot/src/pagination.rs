 * Detailed end-user documentation for pagination lives in the Dropshot top-
 * level block comment.  Here we discuss some of the design choices.
 *
 * ## Background: patterns for pagination
 *
 * [In their own API design guidelines, Google describes an approach similar to
 * the one we use][1].  There are many ways to implement the page token with
 * many different tradeoffs.  The one described in the Dropshot top-level block
 * comment has a lot of nice properties:
 *
 * * For APIs backed by a database of some kind, it's usually straightforward to
 *   use an existing primary key or other unique, sortable field (or combination
 *   of fields) as the token.
 *
 * * If the client scans all the way through the collection, they will see every
 *   object that existed both before the scan and after the scan and was not
 *   renamed during the scan.  (This isn't true for schemes that use a simple
 *   numeric offset as the token.)
 *
 * * There's no server-side state associated with the token, so it's no problem
 *   if the server crashes between requests or if subsequent requests are
 *   handled by a different instance.  (This isn't true for schemes that store
 *   the result set on the server.)
 *
 * * It's often straightforward to support a reversed-order scan as well -- this
 *   may just be a matter of flipping the inequality used for a database query.
 *
 * * It's easy to support sorting by a single field, and with some care it's
 *   possible to support queries on multiple different fields, even at the same
 *   time.  An API can support listing by any unique, sortable combination of
 *   fields.  For example, say our Projects have a modification time ("mtime")
 *   as well.  We could support listing projects alphabetically by name _or_ in
 *   order of most recently modified.  For the latter, since the modification
 *   time is generally not unique, and the marker must be unique, we'd really be
 *   listing by an ("mtime" descending, "name" ascending) tuple.
 *
 * The interfaces here are intended to support this sort of use case.  For APIs
 * backed by traditional RDBMS databases, see [this post for background on
 * various ways to page through a large set of data][2].  (What we're describing
 * here leverages what this post calls "keyset pagination".)
 *
 * Another consideration in designing pagination is whether the token ought to
 * be explicit and meaningful to the user or just an opaque token (likely
 * encoded in some way).  It can be convenient for developers to use APIs where
 * the token is explicitly intended to be one of the fields of the object (e.g.,
 * so that you could list animals starting in the middle by just requesting
 * `?animal_name=moose`), but this puts constraints on the server because
 * clients may come to depend on specific fields being supported and sorted in a
 * certain way.  Dropshot takes the approach of using an encoded token that
 * includes information about the whole scan (e.g., the sort order).  This makes
 * it possible to identify cases that might otherwise result in confusing
 * behavior (e.g., a client lists projects in ascending order, but then asks for
 * the next page in descending order).  The token also includes a version number
 * so that it can be evolved in the future.
 *
 *
 * ## Background: Why paginate HTTP APIs in the first place?
 *
 * Pagination helps ensure that the cost of a request in terms of resource
 * utilization remains O(1) -- that is, it can be bounded above by a constant
 * rather than scaling proportionally with any of the request parameters.  This
 * simplifies utilization monitoring, capacity planning, and scale-out
 * activities for the service, since operators can think of the service in terms
 * of one unit that needs to be scaled up.  (It's still a very complex process,
 * but it would be significantly harder if requests weren't O(1).)
 *
 * Similarly, pagination helps ensure that the time required for a request is
 * O(1) under normal conditions.  This makes it easier to define expectations
 * for service latency and to monitor that latency to determine if those
 * expectations are violated.  Generally, if latency increases, then the service
 * is unhealthy, and a crisp definition of "unhealthy" is important to operate a
 * service with high availability.  If requests weren't O(1), an increase in
 * latency might just reflect a changing workload that's still performing within
 * expectations -- e.g., clients listing larger collections than they were
 * before, but still getting results promptly.  That would make it much harder
 * to see when the service really is unhealthy.
 *
 * Finally, bounding requests to O(1) work is a critical mitigation for common
 * (if basic) denial-of-service (DoS) attacks because it requires that clients
 * consume resources commensurate with the server costs that they're imposing.
 * If a service exposes an API that does work proportional to some parameter,
 * then it's cheap to launch a DoS on the service by just invoking that API with
 * a large parameter.  By contrast, if the client has to do work that scales
 * linearly with the work the server has to do, then the client's costs go up in
 * order to scale up the attack.
 *
 * Along these lines, connections and requests consume finite server resources
 * like open file descriptors and database connections.  If a service is built
 * so that requests are all supposed to take about the same amount of time (or
 * at least that there's a constant upper bound), then it may be possible to use
 * a simple timeout scheme to cancel requests that are taking too long, as might
 * happen if a malicious client finds some way to cause requests to hang or take
 * a very long time.

/**
 * Querystring parameters provided by clients when scanning a paginated
 * collection
 *
 * To build an API endpoint that paginates results, you have your handler
 * function accept a `Query<PaginationParams<ScanParams, PageSelector>>` and
 * return a [`ResultsPage`].  You define your own `ScanParams` and
 * `PageSelector` types.
 *
 * `ScanParams` describes the set of querystring parameters that your endpoint
 * accepts for the _first_ request of the scan (typically: filters and sort
 * options).  This must be deserializable from a querystring.
 *
 * `PageSelector` describes the information your endpoint needs for requests
 * after the first one.  Typically this would include an id of some sort for the
 * last item on the previous page as well as any parameters related to filtering
 * or sorting so that your function can apply those, too.  The entire
 * `PageSelector` will be serialized to an opaque string and included in the
 * [`ResultsPage`].  The client is expected to provide this string as the
 * `"page_token"` querystring parameter in the subsequent request.
 * `PageSelector` must implement both [`Deserialize`] and [`Serialize`].
 * (Unlike `ScanParams`, `PageSelector` will not be deserialized directly from
 * the querystring.)
 *
 * There are several complete, documented examples in `dropshot/examples`.
 *
 * **NOTE:** Your choices of `ScanParams` and `PageSelector` determine the
 * querystring parameters accepted by your endpoint and the structure of the
 * page token, respectively.  Both of these are part of your API's public
 * interface, though the page token won't appear in the OpenAPI spec.  Be
 * careful when designing these structures to consider what you might want to
 * support in the future.
