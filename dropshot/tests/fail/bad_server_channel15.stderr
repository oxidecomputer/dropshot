   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ future created by async block is not `Send`
   |
   = help: within `{async block@$DIR/tests/fail/bad_server_channel15.rs:21:43: 27:6}`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc<i32>`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

24 |         let _non_send_type = Rc::new(0);
   |             -------------- has type `Rc<i32>` which is not `Send`
25 |         tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1)).await;
   |                                                      ^^^^^ await occurs here, with `_non_send_type` maybe used later
