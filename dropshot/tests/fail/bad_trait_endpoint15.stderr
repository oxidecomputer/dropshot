   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ future created by async block is not `Send`
   |
   = help: within `{async block@$DIR/tests/fail/bad_trait_endpoint15.rs:21:49: 27:6}`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc<i32>`, which is required by `{async block@$DIR/tests/fail/bad_trait_endpoint15.rs:21:49: 27:6}: Send`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await
