= Trybuild fail tests

This directory contains a number of test fixtures run via https://docs.rs/trybuild[trybuild]. All of these tests are expected to produce compile-time failures. The goal of these tests is to ensure that we produce reasonable error messages--or at least that we turn good error messages into bad ones.

Each test fixture should test one endpoint. While it's possible to stuff several endpoints into a single test fixture, it becomes hard to read the errors and ensure that all the right ones are being generated.

== Numbered tests

There are several tests here of the general form:

- `bad_endpointN.rs`
- `bad_channelN.rs`
- `bad_server_endpointN.rs`
- (once supported) `bad_server_channelN.rs`

The specific situations being tested are mirrored across tests with the same N. For example, `bad_endpoint2.rs` and `bad_channel2.rs` test the situation where a `self` argument is passed in.

=== `bad_channel` tests

- Some of these tests may be mirrored as multiple closely-related tests. For example, endpoints require that at least one argument is present, so `bad_endpoint1.rs` tests the situation where no arguments have been provided. But channels require that at least _two_ arguments are present, so we have `bad_channel1a.rs`, which passes in zero arguments, and `bad_channel1b.rs`, which passes in one argument.

- Some of these tests may be moot. In this case, we check in text files with the rationale for skipping. For example, `bad_channel7.txt`.

In either case, we do not renumber tests--instead, we skip that number so the fixtures afterwards stay consistent.

=== `bad_server_endpoint` tests

(... and `bad_server_channel` tests once supported)

These tests ensure that trait-based servers fail gracefully. Notably, *we should almost always generate the original trait* with all items (to the best of our ability), so these tests also include an implementation of the trait. The error output ensures that items aren't missing.

=== Server-only tests

Trait-based Dropshot servers introduce new and exciting failure modes. Tests that only make sense for trait-based servers are named `bad_server_onlyN.rs`.

Most server-only tests are generally agnostic to endpoint versus context, or just don't have any tests. Hence they aren't split up into their own endpoint and channel tests.

Like the `bad_server_endpoint` tests, these tests include an implementation of the trait to ensure that it is still generated.

Since trait-based servers are strictly more complex than function-based servers, there are no function-only tests. All function-based tests have trait-based equivalents.

== Updating to new Rust versions

When upgrading to newer Rust versions in `rust-toolchain.toml`, compiler errors can sometimes change.

- If the changes are desirable or otherwise immaterial, then it's easiest to just update the checked-in `.stderr` files via `TRYBUILD=overwrite`. For example: https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/903[#903].
- If the changes obscure the thing we're testing, we've had to sometimes adjust our tests. For example: https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/727[#727].
- Rarely, there have been regressions as a result of which we've had to file bugs against the Rust compiler. For example, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76360[Rust issue #76360].

== Disabling import warnings

Tests in this repo are annotated with `#![allow(unused_imports)]`. That's because when a compiler error is thrown, imports which haven't yet successfully been used may throw "unused import" warnings. This is often a false positive, as the compiler error itself blocks intended usage.

Disabling unused import warnings removes these irrelevant messages, helping us to focus on the actual compile errors we care about.
