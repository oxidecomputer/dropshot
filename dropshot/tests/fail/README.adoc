= Trybuild fail tests

This directory contains a number of test fixtures run via https://docs.rs/trybuild[trybuild]. All of these tests are expected to produce compile-time failures. The goal of these tests is to ensure that we produce reasonable error messages--or at least that we turn good error messages into bad ones.

Each test fixture should test one endpoint. While it's possible to stuff several endpoints into a single test fixture, it becomes hard to read the errors and ensure that all the right ones are being generated.

== Numbered tests

There are several tests here of the general form:

- `bad_endpointN.rs`
- `bad_channelN.rs`
- `bad_trait_endpointN.rs`
- `bad_trait_channelN.rs`

The specific situations being tested are mirrored across tests with the same N. For example, `bad_endpoint2.rs` and `bad_channel2.rs` test the situation where a `self` argument is passed in.

=== `bad_channel` tests

- Some of these tests may be mirrored as multiple closely-related tests. For example, endpoints require that at least one argument is present, so `bad_endpoint1.rs` tests the situation where no arguments have been provided. But channels require that at least _two_ arguments are present, so we have `bad_channel1a.rs`, which passes in zero arguments, and `bad_channel1b.rs`, which passes in one argument.

- Some of these tests may be moot. In this case, we check in text files with the rationale for skipping. For example, `bad_channel7.txt`.

In either case, we do not renumber tests--instead, we skip that number so the fixtures afterwards stay consistent.

=== `bad_trait_endpoint` and `bad_trait_channel` tests

These tests ensure that API traits fail gracefully. Notably, *we should almost always generate the original trait* with all items (to the best of our ability), so these tests also include an implementation of the trait, as well as calls into the support module. The error output ensures that items aren't missing.

=== Trait-only tests

Dropshot API traits introduce new and exciting failure modes. Tests that only make sense for API traits are named `bad_trait_onlyN.rs`.

Most trait-only tests are generally agnostic to endpoint versus channel, or just don't have any endpoints at all. Hence they aren't split up into their own endpoint and channel tests.

Like the `bad_trait_endpoint` tests, these tests include an implementation of the trait to ensure that it is still generated.

Since trait-based APIs are strictly more complex than function-based APIs, there are no function-only tests. All function-based tests have trait-based equivalents.

== Updating to new Rust versions

When upgrading to newer Rust versions in `rust-toolchain.toml`, compiler errors can sometimes change.

- If the changes are desirable or otherwise immaterial, then it's easiest to just update the checked-in `.stderr` files via `TRYBUILD=overwrite`. For example: https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/903[#903].
- If the changes obscure the thing we're testing, we've had to sometimes adjust our tests. For example: https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/727[#727].
- Rarely, there have been regressions as a result of which we've had to file bugs against the Rust compiler. For example, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76360[Rust issue #76360].

== Disabling import warnings

Tests in this repo are annotated with `#![allow(unused_imports)]`. That's because when a compiler error is thrown, imports which haven't yet successfully been used may throw "unused import" warnings. This is often a false positive, as the compiler error itself blocks intended usage.

Disabling unused import warnings removes these irrelevant messages, helping us to focus on the actual compile errors we care about.
