=== Breaking Changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/676[#676] changed how TLS configuration is provided to Dropshot.  **`ConfigDropshotTls` is now no longer part of `ConfigDropshot`.**  If you're using TLS, you need to provide this as a separate argument to `HttpServerStarter::new_tls()`.  See #676 for details.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/651[#651] The address of the remote peer is now available to request handlers via the `RequestInfo` struct. With this change we've removed the related `From<hyper::Request<B>>` implementation; instead use `RequestInfo::new<B>(&hyper::Request<B>, std::net::SocketAddr)`.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/701[#701] changes how Dropshot manages the tasks that are used to handle requests.  There are two modes, now configurable server-wide using `HandlerTaskMode`.  Prior to this change, the behavior matched what's now called `HandlerTaskMode::CancelOnDisconnect`: the Future associated with a request handler could be cancelled if, for example, the client disconnected early.  After this change, the default behavior is what's now called `HandlerTaskMode::Detached`, which causes Dropshot to use `tokio::spawn` to run the request handler.  That task will never be cancelled.  This is useful for consumers whose request handlers may not be cancellation-safe.

=== Other notable Changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/660[#660] The `x-dropshot-pagination` extension used to be simply the value `true`. Now it is an object with a field, `required`, that is an array of parameters that are mandatory on the first invocation.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/776[#776] Dropshot endpoints can now specify `method = HEAD`.

== 0.9.0 (released 2023-01-20)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.8.0\...v0.9.0[Full list of commits]

=== Breaking Changes

There are a number of breaking changes in this release but we expect they will be easy to manage.  **If you have any trouble updating to this release or want help with it, please do https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/discussions[start a discussion] or https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/new[file an issue]!**

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/558[#558] Remove `Arc` around `RequestContext`.  Previously, endpoint functions and extractors accepted `Arc<RequestContext<T>>`.  They now accept just `RequestContext<T>`.  This better reflects the intent that the `RequestContext` is provided for the duration of your endpoint function.
+
We expect this to be an annoying (sorry) but otherwise easy change for consumers to make.  If it's tricky for some reason, please file an issue.
+
**What you need to do:**
+
1. For every endpoint function, change the type of the first argument from `Arc<RequestContext<T>>` to `RequestContext<T>`.  In case it's useful, the following vim command worked to convert most of the cases we've seen: `%s/Arc<RequestContext<\([^>]*\)>>/RequestContext<\1>/gc`.
2. For any type you've defined that impls `Extractor`, you will need to adjust the arguments similarly.  See the next bullet item to fix these for both this change and #556.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/556[#556] Better type-safety around the use of extractors.  It is now a compile-time error to define an endpoint that accepts two extractors that use the HTTP request body (e.g., to accept both a `TypedBody` and an `UntypedBody`, or two `TypedBody` arguments).  Previously, this would have resulted in a runtime error.  The main change is that the `Extractor` trait has been split into two separate traits: `SharedExtractor` and `ExclusiveExtractor`.  Endpoint functions can still accept 0-3 extractors, but only one can be an `ExclusiveExtractor` and it must be the last one.  The function signatures for `*Extractor::from_request` have also changed.
+
**What you need to do:**
+
1. For any endpoint functions that use a `TypedBody`, `UntypedBody`, or `WebsocketConnection` extractor, this extractor must be the last argument to the function.  Otherwise, you will get a compile error about the extractor not impl'ing `SharedExtractor`.
2. If you have your own type that impls `Extractor`, you will need to change that to either `ExclusiveExtractor` (if the impl needs a `mut` reference to the underlying `hyper::Request`, which is usually because it needs to read the request body) or `SharedExtractor`.  If your extractor only needs to look at the URL or request headers and not the body, it can probably be a `SharedExtractor`.  If it's an exclusive extractor, any function that accepts it must accept it as the last argument to the function.
3. Again if you have your own type that impls `Extractor`, having now updated it to either `SharedExtractor` or `ExclusiveExtractor`, you will also need to change the type signature of the `from_request` method to accept a `&RequestContext<T>` instead of `Arc<RequestContext<T>>`.  (This should not be a problem unless your extractor was hanging on to a reference via the Arc.  We don't know a reason this would be useful.  If you were doing this, please https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/discussions[start a discussion] or https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/new[file an issue].  In the meantime, you likely can copy whatever information you need out of the `RequestContext` rather than cloning the Arc.)
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/557[#557] Simpler, safer access to raw request.  Prior to this change, the raw `hyper::Request` (`http::Request`) was accessible to endpoint functions via the `RequestContext`, but behind an `Arc<Mutex<...>>`.  This was a little strange because your endpoint function was usually the only one with a reference to this object.  (You could get into trouble if you defined your own Extractor that cloned one of the `Arc` objects -- your extractor could deadlock with the handler.)  After this change, the raw request is available only through a separate `RawRequest` extractor.  This is an exclusive extractor, which means you cannot use it with `TypedBody` or `UntypedBody`.  As a result, there is no way to wind up with multiple references to the request.  There's no lock and no way to get into this sort of trouble.
+
After this change, the `hyper::Request` is passed as a separate argument to `ExclusiveExtractor::from_request()`.
+
**What you need to do:**
+
1. If you have a request handler that accesses `rqctx.request`, it's typically doing `let request = rqctx.request.lock().await`.
a. If that code is only accessing the HTTP method, URI, headers, or version, then _you can skip this step_.  However, it's recommended that you replace that with `let request = &rqctx.request`.  (That object has methods compatible with `http::Request` for accessing the method, URI, headers, and version.)
b. If that code is accessing other parts of the request (e.g., reading the body or doing a protocol upgrade), then you must instead add a `raw_request: RawRequest` argument to your endpoint function.  Then you can use `let request = raw_request.into_inner()`.
2. If you have an extractor that access `rqctx.request`, then it too is typically doing something like `let request = rqctx.request.lock().await`.
a. If that code is only accessing the HTTP method, URI, headers, or version, then just like above _you can skip this step_, but it's recommended that you replace that with `let request = &rqctx.request`.  This can be done from a `SharedExtractor` or an `ExclusiveExtractor`.
b. If that code is accessing other parts of the request (e.g., reading the body or doing a protocol upgrade), then this extractor must impl `ExclusiveExtractor` (not `SharedExtractor`).  With `ExclusiveExtractor`, the `hyper::Request` is available as an argument to `from_request()`.
+
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/504[#504] Dropshot now allows TLS configuration to be supplied either by path or as bytes. For compatibility, the `AsFile` variant of `ConfigTls` contains the `cert_file` and `key_file` fields, and may be used similarly to the old variant.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/502[#502] Dropshot exposes a `refresh_tls` method to update the TLS certificates being used by a running server.
+
**What you need to do:** If you previously tried to access `DropshotState.tls`, you can access the `DropshotState.using_tls()` method instead.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/540[#540] `ConfigDropshot` now uses a https://docs.rs/camino/1.1.1/camino/struct.Utf8PathBuf.html[`camino::Utf8PathBuf`] for its file path. There is no change to the configuration format itself, just its representation in Rust.

We realize this was a lot of breaking changes.  We expect that most of these will affect few people (there don't seem to be a lot of custom extractor impls out there).  The rest are pretty mechanical.  We hope the result will be a safer, easier to use API.

=== Other notable Changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/522[#522] Dropshot's DTrace
 probes can now be used with a stable compiler on all platforms. This requires
 Rust >= 1.59 for most platforms, or >= 1.66 for macOS.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/452[#452] Dropshot no longer enables the `slog` cargo features `max_level_trace` and `release_max_level_debug`. Previously, clients were unable to set a release log level of `trace`; now they can. However, clients that did not select their own max log levels will see behavior change from the levels Dropshot was choosing to the default levels of `slog` itself (`debug` for debug builds and `info` for release builds).
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/451[#451] There are now response types to support 302 ("Found"), 303 ("See Other"), and 307 ("Temporary Redirect") HTTP response codes.  See `HttpResponseFound`, `HttpResponseSeeOther`, and `HttpResponseTemporaryRedirect`.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/503[#503] Add an optional `deprecated` field to the `#[endpoint]` macro.

== 0.8.0 (released 2022-09-09)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.7.0\...v0.8.0[Full list of commits]

=== Breaking Changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/403[#403] Dropshot now supports WebSockets.  See the docs for details.
+
As part of this, the `ExtractorMetadata` type has been changed to represent our nonstandard extensions to OpenAPI in a field `extension_mode: ExtensionMode`, rather than `paginated: bool`, which was previously our only nonstandard extension, but is now joined by WebSockets.
+
In any existing code that checked `extractor_metadata.paginated`, you can instead check that `extractor_metadata.extension_mode` is `ExtensionMode::Paginated`.

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/351[#351] The `uuid` crate has been updated to version 1.0.0 from 0.8.0. Consumers will need to update to a compatible version of `uuid`. In addition consumers that were using the `uuid` feature flag of the `schemars` crate (so that `uuid::Uuid` implements `schemars::JsonSchema`) will need to use the `uuid1` feature flag instead to force the use of `uuid` version 1.0.0.

=== Other notable changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/363[#363] You can now decode `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies by specifying the `content_type` property when you invoke the `endpoint` macro.  See docs for details.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/370[#370] You can now define handlers for the `OPTIONS` HTTP method.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/420[#420] Handlers can now determine whether the request came in over HTTP or HTTPS using `rqctx.server.tls`.

== 0.7.0 (released 2022-05-06)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.6.0\...v0.7.0[Full list of commits]

=== Breaking Changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/197[#197] Endpoints using wildcard path params (i.e. those using the `/foo/{bar:.*}` syntax) previously could be included in OpenAPI output albeit in a form that was invalid. Specifying a wildcard path **without** also specifying `unpublished = true` is now a **compile-time error**.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/204[#204] Rust 1.58.0-nightly introduced a new feature `asm_sym` which the `usdt` crate requires on macOS. As of this change 1.58.0-nightly or later is required to build with the `usdt-probes` feature on macOS.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/310[#310] changed the name of `HttpResponse::metadata()` to `HttpResponse::response_metadata()`.

=== Other notable changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/198[#198] Responses that used `()` (the unit type) as their `Body` type parameter previously (and inaccurately) were represented in OpenAPI as an empty `responseBody`. They are now more accurately represented as a body whose value is `null` (4 bytes). We encourage those use cases to instead use either `HttpResponseUpdatedNoContent` or `HttpResponseDeleted` both of which have empty response bodies. If there are other situations where you would like a response type with no body, please file an issue.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/252[#252] Endpoints specified with the `##[endpoint ..]` attribute macro now use the first line of a doc comment as the OpenAPI `summary` and subsequent lines as the `description`. Previously all lines were used as the `description`.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/260[#260] Pulls in a newer serde that changes error messages around parsing NonZeroU32.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/283[#283] Add support for response headers with the `HttpResponseHeaders` type. Headers may either be defined by a struct type parameter (in which case they appear in the OpenAPI output) or *ad-hoc* added via `HttpResponseHeaders::headers_mut()`.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/286[#286] OpenAPI output includes descriptions of 4xx and 5xx error responses.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/296[#296] `ApiDescription` includes a `tag_config` method to specify both predefined tags with descriptions and links as well as a tag policy to ensure that endpoints, for example, only use predefined tags or have at least one tag.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/317[#317] Allow use of usdt probes with stable Rust. Dropshot consumers can build with USDT probes enabled on stable compilers >= 1.59 (except on MacOS).
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/310[#310] Freeform (and streaming) response bodies may be specified with specific HTTP response codes e.g. by having an endpoint return `Result<HttpResponseOk<FreeformBody>, HttpError>`.
- https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/325[#325] The example field (if present) for `JsonSchema` objects in the API will be present in the OpenAPI output (and note that no validation of the example is performed)

== 0.6.0 (released 2021-11-18)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.5.1\...v0.6.0[Full list of commits]

=== Breaking Changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/100[#100] The type used for the "limit" argument for paginated resources has changed.  This limit refers to the number of items that an HTTP client can ask for in a single request to a paginated endpoint.  The limit is now 4294967295, where it may have previously been larger.  This is not expected to affect consumers because this limit is far larger than practical.  For details, see #100.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/116[#116] Unused, non-`pub` endpoints from the `&#35;[endpoint { ... }]` macro now produce a lint warning. This is *technically* a breaking change for those who may have had unused endpoints and compiled with `&#35;[deny(warning)]` or `&#35;[deny(dead_code)]` thus implicitly relying on the *absence* of a warning about the endpoint being unused.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/118[#118] Path handling has changed. Escape sequences are decoded so that path parameters will no longer include those escape sequences. In addition, paths for endpoints added via `ApiDescription::register()` may not contain consecutive "/" characters.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/161[#161] The `ApiDescription::print_openapi()` interface (previously deprecated) has been removed. Now use `ApiDescription::openapi()` followed by a call to `OpenApiDefinition::write()` for equivalent functionality.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/103[#103] When the Dropshot server is dropped before having been shut down, Dropshot now attempts to gracefully shut down rather than panic.

=== Other notable changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/105[#105] When generating an OpenAPI spec, Dropshot now uses references rather than inline schemas to represent request and response bodies.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/110[#110] Wildcard paths are now supported. Consumers may take over routing (e.g. for file serving) by annotating a path component: `/static/{path:.*}`. The `path` member should then be of type `Vec<String>` and it will be filled in with all path components following `/static/`.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/148[#148] Adds local/remote addresses to loggers, including those passed in the context to actual endpoint handlers. This fixes https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/46[#46], allowing logs for a client to be correlated from connection to completion.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/164[#164] Add `make_request_with_request` to test utils alongside existing `make_request_with_body`. The caller can specify things like headers by passing in a request.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/160[#160] Adds DTrace USDT probes for a request start and finish, with details about the request and response.  For more information, see the crate-level documentation.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/108[#108] The use of permissive schemas (e.g. serde_json::Value) in API types is allowed.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/123[#123] and https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/133[#133] add several checks on endpoint function signatures.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/128[#128] The use of newtype structs in path and query parameters is now supported.


== 0.5.1 (released 2021-03-18)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.5.0\...v0.5.1[Full list of commits]

* Fixes the dependency on the `openapiv3` crate.  Because of this problem, builds against Dropshot 0.5.0 will not work.

== 0.5.0 (released 2021-03-03)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.4.0\...v0.5.0[Full list of commits]

WARNING: This release does not build due to downstream dependencies.  See 0.5.1.

=== Breaking Changes

==== Generic Context

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/86[#86] Dropshot now uses generics to store client context, rather than relying on an internal `Any` object within `RequestContext`. Endpoints signatures are expected to begin with the argument `rqctx: Arc<RequestContext<CallerContext>>`, for some `CallerContext` object, and they may call `rqtcx.context()` to access the inner type.
* To provide this generic context, many Dropshot types are now generic, acting on a specialized context object (this includes `ApiDescription`, `ApiEndpoint`, `OpenApiDefinition`, `HttpServer`, `HttpServerStarter`, and `RequestContext`). For the most part, the specialization is made implicit by passing the context argument to an `HttpServerStarter` (formerly `HttpServer`).

```rust
struct ExampleContext { ... }

// Old Version:
#[endpoint { method = GET, path = "/endpoint" }]
pub async fn example_endpoint(
    rqctx: Arc<RequestContext>,
) -> Result<HttpResponseOk<...>, HttpError> {
    let ctx: Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync + 'static> = Arc::clone(&rqctx.server.private);
    let example_context = ctx.downcast::<ExampleContext>().expect("Wrong type");
    ...
}

// New Version
#[endpoint { method = GET, path = "/endpoint" }]
pub async fn example_endpoint(
    rqctx: Arc<RequestContext<ExampleContext>>,
) -> Result<HttpResponseOk<...>, HttpError> {
    let example_context = rqctx.context();
    ...
}
```

==== HttpServer

See https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/81[#81 for details]

===== HttpServer Split in Two
* In the old implementation, `HttpServer` represented both a pending and running server. Callers were expected to invoke `run()` to begin execution of the old server.
* In the new implementation, `HttpServerStarter` may be used to construct a server, and `HttpServer` represents the running server. Invoking `HttpServerStarter::start()` creates and `HttpServer` object, which represents the new server.

===== HttpServer implements Future
* In the old implementation, `HttpServer` returned a `tokio::JoinHandle`, and callers were expected to invoke `wait_for_shutdown` to await the completion of a server.
* In the new implementation, `HttpServer` implements `Future`, and may be `await`-ed directly.

===== Example

```rust
// Old Version:
let mut server = HttpServer::new( /* Arguments are the same between versions */ )
  .map_err(|error| format!("failed to start server: {}", error))?;

let server_task = server.run();
server.wait_for_shutdown(server_task).await;

// New Version
let server = HttpServerStarter::new( /* Arguments are the same between versions */ )
  .map_err(|error| format!("failed to start server: {}", error))?
  .start();

server.await;
```

=== Notable changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/44[#44] The new extractor `UntypedBody` allows API endpoints to accept either raw bytes or a UTF-8 string.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/90[#90] `HttpError` now impls `std::error::Error`.

== 0.4.0 (released 2021-02-01)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.3.0\...v0.4.0[Full list of commits]

=== Breaking changes

* Dropshot now uses tokio 1.0 and hyper 0.14.  tokio 1.0 is incompatible at runtime with previous versions (0.2 and earlier).  Consumers must update to tokio 1.0 when updating to Dropshot {{version}}.  tokio does not expect to introduce new breaking changes in the foreseeable future, so we do not expect to have to do this again.

=== Deprecated

* `ApiDescription::print_openapi()` is now deprecated.  It's been replaced with `ApiDescription::openapi()`.  See #68 below.

=== Other notable changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/68[#68] Improve ergonomics of OpenAPI definition generation.  This change deprecates `ApiDescription::print_openapi()`, replacing it with the easier-to-use `ApiDescription::openapi()`, which provides a builder interface.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/64[#64] The maximum request size is now configurable.  It defaults to the previously hardcoded value of 1024 bytes.  (The default is aggressive just to ensure test coverage.)
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/61[#61] The schemars dependency is updated to 0.8.  Consumers must be using the same version of schemars.  (See https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/67[#67].)

== Prior to 0.3.0
