// cargo-release: next header goes here (do not change this line)

== Unreleased changes (release date TBD)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.4.0\...HEAD[Full list of commits]

// WARNING: This file is modified programmatically by `cargo release` as
// configured in release.toml.  DO NOT change the format of the headers or the
// list of raw commits.

=== Notable changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/44[#44] The new extractor `UntypedBody` allows API endpoints to accept either raw bytes or a UTF-8 string.

== 0.4.0 (released 2021-02-01)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.3.0\...v0.4.0[Full list of commits]

=== Breaking changes

* Dropshot now uses tokio 1.0 and hyper 0.14.  tokio 1.0 is incompatible at runtime with previous versions (0.2 and earlier).  Consumers must update to tokio 1.0 when updating to Dropshot {{version}}.  tokio does not expect to introduce new breaking changes in the foreseeable future, so we do not expect to have to do this again.

=== Deprecated

* `ApiDescription::print_openapi()` is now deprecated.  It's been replaced with `ApiDescription::openapi()`.  See #68 below.

=== Other notable changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/68[#68] Improve ergonomics of OpenAPI definition generation.  This change deprecates `ApiDescription::print_openapi()`, replacing it with the easier-to-use `ApiDescription::openapi()`, which provides a builder interface.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/64[#64] The maximum request size is now configurable.  It defaults to the previously hardcoded value of 1024 bytes.  (The default is aggressive just to ensure test coverage.)
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/61[#61] The schemars dependency is updated to 0.8.  Consumers must be using the same version of schemars.  (See https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/67[#67].)

== Prior to 0.3.0
