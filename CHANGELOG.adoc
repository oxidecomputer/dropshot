== Unreleased changes (release date TBD)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.5.1\...HEAD[Full list of commits]

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/105[#105] When generating an OpenAPI spec, Dropshot now uses references rather than inline schemas to represent request and response bodies.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/103[#103] When the Dropshot server is dropped before having been shut down, Dropshot now attempts to gracefully shut down rather than panic.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/110[#110] Wildcard paths are now supported. Consumers may take over routing (e.g. for file serving) by annotating a path component: `/static/{path:.*}`. The `path` member should then be of type `Vec<String>` and it will be filled in with all path components following `/static/`.

=== Breaking Changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/100[#100] The type used for the "limit" argument for paginated resources has changed.  This limit refers to the number of items that an HTTP client can ask for in a single request to a paginated endpoint.  The limit is now 4294967295, where it may have previously been larger.  This is not expected to affect consumers because this limit is far larger than practical.  For details, see #100.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/116[#116] Unused, non-`pub` endpoints from the `&#35;[endpoint { ... }]` macro now produce a lint warning. This is *technically* a breaking change for those who may have had unused endpoints and compiled with `&#35;[deny(warning)]` or `&#35;[deny(dead_code)]` thus implicitly relying on the *absence* of a warning about the endpoint being unused.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/118[#118] Path handling has changed. Escape sequences are decoded so that path parameters will no longer include those escape sequences. In addition, paths for endpoints added via `ApiDescription::register()` may not contain consecutive "/" characters.

== 0.5.1 (released 2021-03-18)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.5.0\...v0.5.1[Full list of commits]

* Fixes the dependency on the `openapiv3` crate.  Because of this problem, builds against Dropshot 0.5.0 will not work.

== 0.5.0 (released 2021-03-03)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.4.0\...v0.5.0[Full list of commits]

WARNING: This release does not build due to downstream dependencies.  See 0.5.1.

=== Breaking Changes

==== Generic Context

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/86[#86] Dropshot now uses generics to store client context, rather than relying on an internal `Any` object within `RequestContext`. Endpoints signatures are expected to begin with the argument `rqctx: Arc<RequestContext<CallerContext>>`, for some `CallerContext` object, and they may call `rqtcx.context()` to access the inner type.
* To provide this generic context, many Dropshot types are now generic, acting on a specialized context object (this includes `ApiDescription`, `ApiEndpoint`, `OpenApiDefinition`, `HttpServer`, `HttpServerStarter`, and `RequestContext`). For the most part, the specialization is made implicit by passing the context argument to an `HttpServerStarter` (formerly `HttpServer`).

```rust
struct ExampleContext { ... }

// Old Version:
#[endpoint { method = GET, path = "/endpoint" }]
pub async fn example_endpoint(
    rqctx: Arc<RequestContext>,
) -> Result<HttpResponseOk<...>, HttpError> {
    let ctx: Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync + 'static> = Arc::clone(&rqctx.server.private);
    let example_context = ctx.downcast::<ExampleContext>().expect("Wrong type");
    ...
}

// New Version
#[endpoint { method = GET, path = "/endpoint" }]
pub async fn example_endpoint(
    rqctx: Arc<RequestContext<ExampleContext>>,
) -> Result<HttpResponseOk<...>, HttpError> {
    let example_context = rqctx.context();
    ...
}
```

==== HttpServer

See https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/81[#81 for details]

===== HttpServer Split in Two
* In the old implementation, `HttpServer` represented both a pending and running server. Callers were expected to invoke `run()` to begin execution of the old server.
* In the new implementation, `HttpServerStarter` may be used to construct a server, and `HttpServer` represents the running server. Invoking `HttpServerStarter::start()` creates and `HttpServer` object, which represents the new server.

===== HttpServer implements Future
* In the old implementation, `HttpServer` returned a `tokio::JoinHandle`, and callers were expected to invoke `wait_for_shutdown` to await the completion of a server.
* In the new implementation, `HttpServer` implements `Future`, and may be `await`-ed directly.

===== Example

```rust
// Old Version:
let mut server = HttpServer::new( /* Arguments are the same between versions */ )
  .map_err(|error| format!("failed to start server: {}", error))?;

let server_task = server.run();
server.wait_for_shutdown(server_task).await;

// New Version
let server = HttpServerStarter::new( /* Arguments are the same between versions */ )
  .map_err(|error| format!("failed to start server: {}", error))?
  .start();

server.await;
```

=== Notable changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/44[#44] The new extractor `UntypedBody` allows API endpoints to accept either raw bytes or a UTF-8 string.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/pull/90[#90] `HttpError` now impls `std::error::Error`.

== 0.4.0 (released 2021-02-01)

https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/compare/v0.3.0\...v0.4.0[Full list of commits]

=== Breaking changes

* Dropshot now uses tokio 1.0 and hyper 0.14.  tokio 1.0 is incompatible at runtime with previous versions (0.2 and earlier).  Consumers must update to tokio 1.0 when updating to Dropshot {{version}}.  tokio does not expect to introduce new breaking changes in the foreseeable future, so we do not expect to have to do this again.

=== Deprecated

* `ApiDescription::print_openapi()` is now deprecated.  It's been replaced with `ApiDescription::openapi()`.  See #68 below.

=== Other notable changes

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/68[#68] Improve ergonomics of OpenAPI definition generation.  This change deprecates `ApiDescription::print_openapi()`, replacing it with the easier-to-use `ApiDescription::openapi()`, which provides a builder interface.
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/64[#64] The maximum request size is now configurable.  It defaults to the previously hardcoded value of 1024 bytes.  (The default is aggressive just to ensure test coverage.)
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/61[#61] The schemars dependency is updated to 0.8.  Consumers must be using the same version of schemars.  (See https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/issues/67[#67].)
