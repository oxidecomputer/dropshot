= OpenAPI manager example: APIs

This crate consists of example API traits under management. This is the base layer, and it depends on link:../../openapi-manager-types[`openapi-manager-types`] but _not_ on the higher-level link:../../openapi-manager[`openapi-manager`] crate.

For more information, see link:../README.adoc[the parent README].
