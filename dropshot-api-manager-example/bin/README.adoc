= OpenAPI manager example: Top-level binary

This crate is the top-level binary that integrates the APIs defined in link:../apis[`apis`] with the higher-level link:../../dropshot-api-manager[`dropshot-api-manager`] crate.

Most of the heavy lifting is done by the `dropshot-api-manager` crate itself; this crate is a thin wrapper around that.

To see the example in action, run `cargo example-openapi`.

For more information, see link:../README.adoc[the parent README].
